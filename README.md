# WebApiGoalRepo
In this repo there are two projects, one deals with creating the Web Api service and another one is for  consuming of that service using a console application.

To make this project behave properly we may need to set up the Database connection as currently it is using local db using mdf file and it doesn't work when this api publishes
to IIS, although it works fine in IISExpress.
